* Introduction

* Problems
1. Modeling and Computation
   - crypto and forex trading
   - sports predictions and betting
2. Data Security
3. Monitoring
   - collection of physical sensors, temperature, etc., with alerting


* Systems
** Learning System
To solve modern learning problems, a powerful CPU and GPU computing solution is necessary.

*** Design

*** Specs
To be determined...
- CPU: ???
- MEMORY: 128 - 192GB
- GPU: 2x 1080ti (22GB vmemory)
- STORAGE:
  - 1TB nvme (working storage)
  - SSD raid (not sure the size)

*** Tooling and Software
1. Jupyter Hub
2. Tensorflow
3. Programming Languages
   1. Python
   2. Haskell
   3. Scala
   4. Go, Rust?

Spark likely is unnecessary, since the learning system is a single machine? Do we want to write our models in Spark anyways so that we can port them easily to larger, distributed systems?

Read only replica of the postgres database on "Data Server"?

** Data Server
A reliable data server allows us to store our data and models with confidence.

*** Design

*** Specs
- CPU: Intel i7-8700K, 6 cores/12 threads @ 4.7GHz
- MEMORY: 32 - 64GB
- GPU: None
- STORAGE: 6x4TB,
  - filesystem?
  - volume manager?
*** Tooling and Software
2. quota


** High-Availability Cluster
Our high availability cluster ensures that we can reliably serve our solutions. Moreover, this represents a learning exercise. The system comprises a collection of Raspberry Pi nodes.

If we plan on doing any medium-to-long frequency trading, a high availability cluster will be an absolute necessity.

*** Design

*** Specs
8xRPi4
- CPU: 8x4 x 1.5GHz
- MEMORY: 8x4GB
- GPU: None
- STORAGE: 8x(32GB SDCard + 32GB USB-3)

*** Tooling and Software
1. Kubernetes
2. High-availability PostgreSql
3. OpenFaaS
4. Grafana for monitoring and alerting
5. Airflow

OpenFaaS can solve many interesting challenges. Some possibilities:
1. Model Ingestion and deployment?

** Common Tooling and Software
1. docker
2. rsync
3. rsnapshot
4. postgresql
